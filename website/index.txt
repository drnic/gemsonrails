h1. Gems On Rails

h1. &#x2192; 'gemsonrails'

h1. aka 'vendor everything'

h2. What

Link or freeze RubyGems into your rails apps, instead of just plugins. This allows you to 'vendor everything' - pushing all dependent gems into your rails app thus ensuring your application will be guaranteed to work when deployed. Your application is no longer dependent on the gems that are/aren't available on your target deployment environment.

h2. Installation and The Basics

First you install the gem:

<pre>$ sudo gem install gemsonrails</pre>

Then you deploy the gem into your target Rails application:

<pre>$ cd rails_app_folder
$ gemsonrails</pre>

This installs some rake tasks into your app to help you freeze or link gems:

<pre>$ rake -T | grep "gems:"
rake gems:freeze    # Freeze a RubyGem into this Rails application; init.rb will be loaded on startup.
rake gems:link      # Link a RubyGem into this Rails application; init.rb will be loaded on startup.
rake gems:unfreeze  # Unfreeze/unlink a RubyGem from this Rails application
</pre>

Finally, for each gem your application uses you can either freeze a version into the app (only for gems that do not require native compilation), or link a gem with your app (useful for gems that require native compilation)

<pre>$ rake gems:freeze GEM=map_by_method
Unpacked map_by_method 0.6.0 to 'map_by_method-0.6.0'

$ ls vendor/gems/map_by_method-0.6.0/
CHANGELOG       README          Rakefile        init.rb         lib             test

$ cat vendor/gems/map_by_method-0.6.0/init.rb 
require File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), 'lib', 'map_by_method')
</pre>

h2. Upgrading from old GemsOnRails versions

All the freezing and linking functionality is in the plugin installed by the <code>gemsonrails</code> command. To upgrade, simple install the new gem version, and re-run the <code>gemsonrails</code> command. You application will now have the newest rake tasks and functionality.

h1. Alternate start files

For exchange with Glenn Rempe:

The problem is that the generated init.rb for the frozen gem guesses incorrectly as to which root file to 'require'

In vendor/gems/net-ssh-1.X.X/init.rb you'll see:
require File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), 'lib', 'net-ssh')

But this points to an invalid file. Try "mongrel_rails start" to get a better error message to show this problem.

So change it to:
require File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), 'lib', 'net', 'ssh')

This generated init.rb makes a best guess about the start file, I guess it could do with some tweaking; or at least test whether the file exists and perhaps try some other algorithms; e.g.

path = "#{$1}/#{$2}" if name[/(\w+)-(\w+)/]

Anyway, I'll put this on the todo list.
